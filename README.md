This is a collection of 3D modeling files done in OpenSCAD
Mostly they were done up through 2011, so the style and code
may contain the usage of several deprecated methods.

Each project may include some interesting coding style I 
discovered with OpenScad.  Some of the more interesting stuff
can be found in the Libraries directory.

OpenScadVM was some experimentation in creating an execution
environment within OpenSCAD.  A more declarative form of programming.
