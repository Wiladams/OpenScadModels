This project contains a simple connector that is meant 
to facilitate torsion box construction.  In particular, when
a torsion box is being built utilizing materials such as cardboard
or corrugated plastic panel.  This connector is meant to
sit atop the vertices where two walls of the box come together.
By doing so, it provides some amount of support at the vertex
which will eliminate the need for other forms of support.
